Responsible consumption and production
Sustainable consumption and production is about doing more and better with less. It is also about decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, increasing resource efficiency and promoting sustainable lifestyles
The transition to sustainable consumption and production of goods and services is necessary to reduce the negative impact on the climate and the environment, and on people's life.
There are plenty of ways we can be responsible in production and consumption. The way Iam going to be responsible is by creating a webapp in which we can borrow things,buy things without money or sell something you have with a reasonable price or another things or give it freely.people from all over the world can be a seller and buyer from this app. A person should upload the image of a thing he want to give and Choose whether he want money or not,some things,or he  wants it after a period of time. People can also sell environmental friendly products like cloth bag,paper pencil...etc through this webapp. In this way I can reduce the irresponsible consumption wherein people buy something they want for one day and then they throw it. In that way if somebody is getting rid of his things, somebody might want it and get it from the person.
